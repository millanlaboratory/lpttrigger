Release 0.0.0.0:
================

	First official release of lpttrigger. It now follows the libtool
	version scheme, thus making the old lpttrigger-0.3 deprecated. This
	release adds also a minimal support for pulse width modulation signal
	on parallel port. However in this state, it works only on linux
	platform.
